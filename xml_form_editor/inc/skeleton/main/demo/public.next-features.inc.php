		This demo gives you an overview of the work we have done so far. The software is working with a lot of other components.
		Those components, almost invisible to the user are the following.
		<ul>
			<li>An ontology</li>
			<li>
				2 databases
				<ul>
					<li>MongoDb to register all data from the ontology</li>
					<li>Neo4j to store the ontology</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		Moreover, we have built the whole website using our own framework. So, the tool is flexible, performant and let us tune it without having to rewrite everything.

	<h3>What's next?</h3>
	<div class="content-separator"></div>
	
	<p>
		This software is not in its final form, it will evolve regarding <b><u>your</u></b> needs! Its modular design will allow us to work in parallel on several aspects.
		That tool we have built has a great power, now it is our responsability to keep you on it.

		<h5>Improving your experience</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Better schema reading:</b><br/>
				Any schema you want to upload will be converted as a form.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Better table module:</b><br/>
				You will no longer have to format your tables!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Better data representation:</b><br/> 
				We understand that XML view is not always the best one, so we are working on new ways of displaying your data.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Brand new features</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>User management</b><br/>
				This software is one of the multiple part composing the repository. With several tools, we do not want several authentications. So we are working on an unified way of managing users.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Explore the repository</b><br/>
				Find an experiment would never have been easier!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Simplify the form</b><br/>
				Keep a low number of pages to keep users on our repository.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Build more module</b><br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Images/videos upload</li>
					<li>Display a periodic table instead of a list</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>And more...</b><br/>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>"Save as" function</b><br/>
						To copy a data set and avoid repetitive job.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Pre-filled fields</b><br/>
						To let you know what kind of data we are waiting for.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
