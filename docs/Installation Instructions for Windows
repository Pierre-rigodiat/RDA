Installation Instructions (Windows)
for Materials Resource Registry

Setup:

For python:

1)	Download python 2.7 for windows 32bits (https://www.python.org/download/)
2)	Add to PATH:
C:\Python27\
C:\Python27\Scripts

For pip:

We need pip to do the installation of the required dependencies.  pip requires setuptools and it has to be installed first, before pip can run: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html 

1)	Download get-pip.py

python get-pip.py 


For the virtual environment:

1)	In a command prompt:
pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
2)	Add environment variable (Win 7 :Start, right click on Computer, Properties, click on Advance system settings in the left panel, go to advanced tab, Environment Variables…, New)
WORKON_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\Develop\Envs
3)	In a command prompt and then :
mkdir %WORKON_HOME%
cd %WORKON_HOME%
mkvirtualenv mgi
4)	To use the environment:
workon mgi (the prompt will change and become mgi. You should always see the mgi prompt when installing new packages)


Configure MongoDB:
Please follow general instructions provided in the file called MongoDB Configuration.

Install all required python packages:

Use the file called Required Python Packages to install them in their good version. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before starting the installation. Instructions specific to Windows platform can be found below.


For ldap:

1)	Install the django-auth-ldap package:
a.	Download django-auth-ldap package from pypi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-auth-ldap/1.2.0)
b.	In a command prompt:
cd PATH_TO_django-auth-ldap_FOLDER
python setup.py install build

For lxml:

1)	Download lxml from pypi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/2.3)
a.	Use the Windows link for Python 2.7 : lxml-2.3.win32-py2.7.exe (win32)
2)	Run the installer
a.	If you use a virtual environment. 
You can’t change the destination folder set in the installer so you will have to install the package in the specified folder (C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\) and then copy the lxml directories from C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\ to %USERPROFILE%\Develop\Envs\mgi\Lib\site-packages.


Running the MRR for the first time:

1)	Run mongodb (if not already running). In a command prompt :
mongod --config /path/to/mrr/conf/mongodb.conf

2)	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py createsuperuser

Answer yes to:
You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):yes


To Run the software:

1)	Run mongodb (if not already running). In a command prompt :
