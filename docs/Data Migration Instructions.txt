Data Migration Instructions (beta pre-release to beta):

MRR users can now migrate their data from version beta pre-release to the version beta.

It is highly recommended that you backup your data before starting the migration process. This backup can be accomplished by creating a zip file of the data/db directory and db.sqlite3 file. 
Please make sure to stop the MongoDB server before creating the zip file. Also, please make sure to save the zip file in a different location. 
If something goes wrong you will be able to restore your data by extracting the zip file back into the MRR directory.

Please follow the instructions below to first update your code to the latest development version and then check that everything is working properly after migrating the data. 

Here are the instructions to follow to update the MRR from version beta pre-release to version beta:
-	1) STOP THE SERVERS (MongoDB, Django)
-	2) BACKUP THE DATA: Make a copy of data/db and db.sqlite3 and place them in a different location

-	3) Update the code with beta
		- Option 1: Pull the latest code from git:
		=> git pull 
		- Option 2: Manual installation 
		Download the new version of the MRR, copy the data\db directory and db.sqlite3 file from MRR beta pre-release in the MRR beta folder
-	4) Update the python packages
	=> pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
-	5) Restart the servers
	=> mongod --config path/to/mongodb.conf
	=> python manage.py runserver
-	6) Migrate SQLite3 database
	=> python manage.py migrate
-	 7) Migrate MongoDB database.
	=> python mgi/migrate.py -u <mongo_admin_user> -p <-mongo_admin_password>

	Please replace <mongo_admin_user> and <mongo_admin_password> with your MongoDB admin user and MongoDB admin password.
	For more information about the migration script options, please use:
	=> python mgi/migrate.py -h
