STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml (http://lxml.de/installation.html)


Running the MRR for the first time:

1)	Run mongodb (if not already running). In a command prompt :
mongod --config /path/to/mrr/conf/mongodb.conf

2)	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py createsuperuser

Answer yes to:
You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):yes


To Run the software:
