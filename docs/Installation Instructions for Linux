For Operating System:

Linux

Prerequisites

Python 2.7.2 (brew install python)
pip (http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest) 

Install Python:
cd ~/
curl -L http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tgz > Python-2.7.2.tgz
tar xzf Python-2.7.2.tgz

Any installed package via pip will now go under your '~/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages' directory.


Setup:

We need pip to do the installation of the required dependencies.  pip requires setuptools and it has to be installed first, before pip can run: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html 

Checkout MGI repository into ~/Develop/Workspaces

cd ~/Develop
mkdir Env
pip install virtualenvwrapper  (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) 
export WORKON_HOME=~/Develop/Envs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
source ~/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
mkvirtualenv mgi

source ~/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
workon mgi

Install all required python packages:
Use the file called Required Python Packages to install them in their good version. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before starting the installation. Instructions specific to Linux platform can be found below.

For lxml:

If you get the error “clang error: linker command failed”, then run the following command instead:
STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml (http://lxml.de/installation.html)

Running the MRR for the first time:

1)	Run mongodb (if not already running). In a command prompt :
mongod --config /path/to/mrr/conf/mongodb.conf

2)	python manage.py migrate
	python manage.py createsuperuser

Answer yes to:
You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):yes


To Run the software:

1)	Run mongodb (if not already running). In a command prompt :

cd path/to/mrr
python manage.py runserver

To be able to access the system remotely, instead of using python manage.py runserver, use: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<port>
