calcination.
The improved process offered an opportunity for a net energy
reduction in fluid flash calciners of 1.6 GJ/ton alumina (and the
subsequent green house gas reductions). This could be retrofitted
into existing fluid flash calciners and produce an alumina meeting
smelting requirements with the added advantage of high attrition
resistance and thus low dust generation.
In this process, alumina hydrate is calcined in two stages. In the
first stage alumina hydrate is heated indirectly to 500'C in a
decomposer vessel under a steam pressure of about 8 atm. About
85% of the combined water is released and is recovered as process
steam. There is also a partial transformation of gibbsite to
boehmite during decomposition involving alteration of the crystal
morphology. The product from the decomposer has about 5% LOI
and is calcined by direct heating to 750-850'C to obtain smelting

The question is: Why hasn't this improvement been incorporated grade alumina. The alumina product has high attrition resistance.

Introduction

Energy requirements for alumina calcination have decreased from
4.5 GJ/t AlgOg to less than 3.0 GJ/t Al4Og following the
replacement of rotary kilns by stationary calciners. Since the
commercial introduction fluid flash calciners in the 1960s, there
have been numerous papers on the development and improvement
in design as well as increases in installed throughput capacities of
this class of calcination equipment [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19,
20, 28, 30]. One major drawback of the new calciners was that
the type of alumina trihydrate particles being produced in alumina
refineries using the new calcination technology tended to break
down and create a significant amount of fine dust during
calcination and that dust, in addition to being an environmental
problem, led to a range of feeding problems for alumina smelters
using the flash calcined aluminas [1].
This problem of dust creation has been mitigated over the years
by the alumina refineries changing precipitation practices to create
''sandy'' ''mosaic'' crystal habit alumina trihydrate particles [2a,
Heat Effects in Hydrate Decomposition
The process of thermal decomposition of alumina hydrate can be
studied from X-ray diffraction, DTA and TGA data [27]. The
TGA plot for a typical American Bayer hydrate is shown in
Figure 1 for atmospheric pressure calcination.

Characteristics of Pressure Decomposer Prodnct
Bench scale decomposition experiments were carried out in a
modified autoclave system with provision to inject dry alumina
hydrate. In a typical run the autoclave was brought to pressure and
temperature by starting with a small amount of water. Hydrate
was then charged from the injection vessel by pressurized gas. A
venting arrangement maintained constant steam pressure in the
autoclave during the test. Range of conditions studied were:

Pressure: 4-30 atmospheres
Temperature: 250-650'C
Residence Time: 30-120 minutes

At the end of the test the autoclave was vented fully and cooled.
The product was removed and examined for properties.
Figures 3, 4, and 5 show boehmite content, surface area, and LOI
values of decomposition products for various test conditions.
Table 1 shows particle size analyses (by sieving) of the feed

atmospheric calcination in an electric furnace for one hour at the
desired temperature. The products were again analyzed for LOI,
surface area, attrition resistance and crystalline phase.
Morphological features were examined by SEM and also by

b. This transformation affects the development of surface

increases to about 70 m2lg under the above conditions. This
surface area value remains practically unchanged after second
stage calcination at 750-850'C.
c. The above decomposer conditions result in a product
having a LOI of about 5%. A final LOI of c1%
(corresponding to smelting grade alumina) can be attained by
carrying out the second stage calcination at the relatively low
temperature of 750-850'C. The final product consists largely

d. The formation of boehmite has considerable impact on
the internal structure of the alumina and consequently on the
attrition behavior.
Figures 6 and 7 show SEM pictures of internal structures of
atmospheric and pressure calcined (after second stage) aluminas.
The absence of cracks and fractures in the pressure calcined
material is remarkable.

Attrition test results confirm the above observations. First, there is
little particle breakdown during the pressure decomposition stage.
Results actually show a slight coarsening effect. Second, the
product from the second stage has very high attrition resistance as
measured by the usual modified Forsythe-Hertwig test. Some
results are given in Table II.

Results also suggest that the residence time of the hydrate in the
decomposer, and hence the extent of transformation to boehmite,


strongly influences later attrition behavior. Higher attrition
resistance corresponded with longer residence time.

Pilot Scale Continuous Decomposer

product quality results from batch operated bench tests with
continuous decomposition tests. The aim was to obtain
information useful for the final design and construction of a full-
scale pressure calcination system. This must include geometry to
incorporate a large amount of surface area for indirect heat
transfer from hot combustion gases, practical feed and discharge
schemes for the decomposer, and recovery of clean steam.
Several practical decomposer designs were considered.
Observations in an externally heated- transparent quartz tube
showed that the decomposition of the hydrate bed is self-
fluidizing due to release of steam. This fluidizing effect can be
utilized to improve heat transfer to the hydrate bed. On this basis,
the most economical design concept for the decomposer
resembles a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger with a self-
fluidized bed of hydrate flowing down the tubes and hot
combustion gases flowing counter currently upwards in the shell.

Design Of Industrial Pressure Calciner
At the time of the original paper the preliminary design of a 76
thr AlOg capacity pressure calciner was worked out based on
bench and pilot plant experience. The design allows retrofitting of
an existing Alcoa fluid-flash calcination system to operate in the
pressure calcination mode. The design utilized a pressurized lock-
hopper system for feeding dry hydrate to the decomposer vessel.
Further development work and implementation of this technology,
however, was stopped at this point.

Discussion

An even more energy efficient unit, not discussed in the previous
paper, would be to build a stand-alone pressure calciner. Wet
filter cake would be fed into a pressurized dryerldecomposer unit
where the alumina would exit at 850'C. A tubular design with
self-fluidized hydratelalumina on the inside of the tubes and POC
on the outside, similar to the retrofit unit discussed above, is
visualized. The hot alumina product could than go to a two-stage
atmospheric indirect cooling section using air and water to cool
the alumina to handling temperature and preheat air for fuel
combustion. In this case all of the steam latent heat from hydrate
moisture and water of hydration would be recovered as usable
steam. Dust collector flow volume and particle load sizing would
be significantly less than in current flash calciners.

Conclusions

By recovering the water released during alumina calcination as
process steam, the Alcoa pressure calcination system decreases
effective heat requirement for alumina calcination to less than 1.6
GJh Al4,
The large gibbsite - boehmite transformation occurring during
pressure decomposition results in a strong attrition resistant
product and enables the production of e1% LOI smelting grade
alumina at the low calcining temperature of 750-850'C. The
surface area of the product is around 70 m2lg suitable for
effective F recovery.
The process was studied in bench and continuous pilot units and
an initial design for a 76 thr alumina pressure calciner was
developed but not implemented.
With the energy saving, ability to retrofit into existing fluid flash
calciners and the ability to produce a better SGA for smelters, it is
very surprising that this technology has languished without being
implementedl
