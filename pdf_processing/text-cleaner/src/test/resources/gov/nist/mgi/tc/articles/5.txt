Abstract

Composites with DGEBA/TETA epoxy matrix reinforced with thinner and continuous bamboo
fibers stripped from culms were mechanically characterized by tensile tests. Specimens with up
to 30% in volume fraction of aligned fibers were tensile ruptured at room temperature. The
results showed a steady increase in both the ultimate strength and the elastic modulus of the
composites with the amount of incorporated bamboo fibers. The fractographic analysis by
scanning electron microscopy showed evidence of moderate adhesion between the bamboo fiber
and the epoxy matrix. This fiberlmatrix adhesion by interaction mechanism apparently justifies
the improved tensile properties of the composites.

Introduction

In recent years polymer composites reinforced with natural fibers, mainly those lignocellulosic
obtained from plants, have been subject to extensive research works [1-5]. Environmental,
economical, societal and technical advantages of these composites are motivating their
substitution for similar polymer composites reinforced with synthetic fibers. In particular, R \&c D
efforts have been conducted aiming to replace glass fibers composites that are comparatively
more abrasive to equipments, non-recyclable, more expensive, heavier and toxic [6].
Among the many lignocellulosic fiber composites being investigated, those fabricated with
bamboo stripped fibers, i.e., fibers longitudinally cut from the culm, still need information to
support possible industrial applications. Several works, however, have been dedicated to bamboo
stripped fibers as possible reinforcement of polymer composites [7-17]. These works reported
mechanical properties that could markedly vary with the type of polymer matrix, the fiber
disposition (if continuous, aligned, short-cut, mat interlayered, etc) and the test condition.
In a recent work [17], it was found that the tensile strength of bamboo stripped fibers varies
inversely with their corresponding diameters. In other words, the thinner the diameter, the
stronger the fiber. This indicates that bamboo fibers have a potential to be applied as composite
reinforcement. Nevertheless, limited amount of tensile data has so far been reported on bamboo
stripped fibers reinforced polymer composites. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to
assess the tensile properties and mechanical characteristics of epoxy composites reinforced with
thinner and continuous bamboo stripped fibers.

Experimental Procedure

Bamboo fibers were longitudinally stripped off from dried culms, supplied by a producer of the
north region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeast of Brazil, following procedure described
elsewhere [17]. For this work, fibers with equivalent diameter thinner than 0.5mm were
considered. Figure 1 illustrates the bamboo longitudinally striped off splints that were selected
for this work, Fig 1(a). It is also shown Fig 1(b), the thinner fibers cut from the splints.

The thinner bamboo stripped fibers used in the present work, Fig. l(b), were dried at 60'C for 24
hours. Tensile specimens were prepared, each at a time, by laying down continuous and aligned
fibers in a rectangular dog-bone shaped silicone mold with 5.8 x 4.5 mm of reduced transversal
dimensions and 35mm of length. Thinner fibers with different volume fraction, up to 30%6, were
set inside the mold along the longitudinal direction corresponding to the tensile axis. The epoxy
resin type diglycidyl ether of the bisphenol-A (DGEBA) with a DER of 374gmol and an
equivalent weight of 187.3gequiv. was mixed with triethylene tetramine (TETA), as hardener, in
stoichiometric ratio corresponding to phr 13. Both DGEBA resin and TETA hardener were
supplied by the DOW Chemical Co. This still fluid mixture was poured onto the fibers inside the
mold and allowed to cure at room temperature (RT) for 24 hours. Seven specimens were
prepared for a given fiber volume fraction.
The specimens were tested at RT in a model DL 10000 EMIC machine at a strain rate of 3x10''
s'', After test, representative fractured samples were placed in a conducting support and then

290


gold-coated to be analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This analysis was
conducted in a model SSX-550 Shimadzu microscope operating with secondary electrons
accelerated by a voltage of 15 kV.

Results and Discussion

From the data acquisition system of the tensile machine, load vs. elongation curves like the ones
exemplified in Fig. 2, were obtained. These curves revealed that both the pure epoxy and the
bamboo fiber composites possess very limited plastic ductility. In fact, after the linear elastic
deformation, a sudden rupture occurred indicating that the investigated tensile specimens present
a brittle behavior.

The macroscopic aspects of typical tensile ruptured specimens for each of the volume fraction of
bamboo stripped fiber reinforced epoxy composite are shown in Fig. 3. In this figure, it should
be noticed that, in general, the fracture occurred in a transversal mode and apparently as a
consequence of cracks propagating throughout the brittle epoxy matrix. The composites with
volume fraction of bamboo fibers above 10%, there are evidences of fiber pieces pointing out of
the fracture surface. Similar situation was observed in flexural tested bamboo fiber composites
with polyester [19] and epoxy [20] matrices as well as tensile tested polyester composites [21]

291


also reinforced with stripped bamboo fibers. This certainly assures that the fibers are
participating in the composite rupture. Since the bamboo fiber is stronger than the epoxy matrix,
the fiber participation indicates a reinforcement effect.

From the data collected from the load vs. elongation curves such as the ones illustrated in Fig. 2,
the average tensile strength (ultimate stress), the elastic modulus and the total strain were
evaluated for the different fiber volume fraction. These results are shown in Table 2 and, in
agreement with the above-discussed, reveal an increase in the tensile properties of the epoxy
composites with increasing volume fraction of bamboo fibers.

Figure 4 presents the graphs associated with the results shown in Table 2. In this figure both the
variation of the tensile strength, Fig. 4(a), and the elastic modulus, Fig. 4(b), with the volume
fraction of bamboo stripped fibers reinforcing epoxy composites are graphically displayed. As
already mentioned, the tensile strength significantly increases with the bamboo fiber volume
fraction. This follows a linear increase, which reaches almost four times, Table 2 and Figure

4(a), the 0% fiber (pure epoxy) strength for the 30% fiber composites. The elastic modulus, Fig.

corroborate those for tensile tested bamboo fiber reinforced polyester matrix composites [21].

A possible explanation for the reinforcement effect of the bamboo fibers to the epoxy matrix,
Table 2 and Fig. 4, may be understood through the fracture analysis of the composites presented
in Fig. 5 and 6.
Details of the typical fracture tip of tensile specimens corresponding to 0%6 (pure epoxy) and
10% volume fraction of bamboo stripped fiber epoxy matrix composites are shown in Fig. 5. The
fracture surface of the pure epoxy, Fig 5(a) is rough and faceted. This can be associated with the
propagation of many cracks through an irregular epoxy matrix, with pores and defects
accumulated during the processing of the tensile specimens. The introduction of a small amount
of 10%i fibers, Fig. 5(b), does not represent an effective obstacle to the crack propagation through
the epoxy matrix.

and (b) 10% volume fraction of bamboo stripped fibers.

Figure 6 shows typical SEM fractographs of a tensile ruptured epoxy composite specimen with
30%i volume fraction of bamboo stripped fibers. With lower magnification, Fig. 6(a), one sees
holes associated with pulled out fibers as well as several fibers well adhered to the epoxy matrix.
Moreover, there is evidence, by fracture marks, that the bamboo fibers are interfering with the
crack propagation through the epoxy matrix. With higher magnification, Fig. 6(b), it should be
noticed the good adhesion between the bamboo fibers and the epoxy matrix. Furthermore, part of
the fibers is not completely broken, which confirms the barrier offered to the crack propagation.

Conclusions

o Tensile tested DGEBA/TETA epoxy composites incorporated with longitudinally culm

stripped bamboo fibers show an improvement in the strength, the elastic modulus and the
total strain as compared to corresponding values of the pure matrix.
o This reinforcement effect, in particular, permits the tensile strength to reach almost four

times the pure epoxy value at 30% of volume fraction of bamboo fibers.
o A SEM fractograph analysis showed evidence of an effective adherence of the bamboo

fibers to the epoxy matrix as well as a barrier action of the fibers to crack propagation.
These mechanisms are apparently responsible for the reinforcement caused to the epoxy
matrix by the stripped bamboo fibers.
