Based on the available thermodynamic parameters and experimental data of self-diffusivity, impurity dif-
fusivity, intrinsic diffusivity, tracer diffusivity and interdiffusivity in the Cu-Si, Al-Siand Al-Cu-Sialloys,
the atomic mobilities of Cu, Al and Si in face-centered cubic (fccA1) Cu-Si, Al-Si and Al-Cu-Si alloys
have been critically assessed as a function of temperature and composition using the CALPHAD-type
and DICTRA software package. Comparisons between the calculated and measured coefficients reveal
that most of the diffusivities can be reproduced satisfactorily. The obtained mobility parameters can
be used to study diffusion-related characteristics for fccA1 Cu-Si, Al-Si and Al-Cu-Si alloys.

temperature range between 900 and 1150 K. Further, the tracer
diffusion coefficients of 'Cu in pure and the alloys containing up
to 1.8 at.X Si at 1130 K were determined by using the serial
sectioning method. By means of the diffusion couple method,
Aaronson et al. [20] determined the interdiffusion coefficients in
fccA1 Cu-5.82 wtS Si alloys from 928 to 1048 K. The interdiffu-
sion coefficients reported by the authors [18-20]are in consistence
with each other, and are thus utilized in the present assessment.
With the Matano-Boltzmann method, Rhines et al. [21] investi-
gated the interdiffusion coefficients of fcc A1 Cu-Si alloys in the
temperature range between 973 and 1075 K. However, the results
[21] are smaller than those of [18-20], and are not utilized in this
work.
3.2. The A-Sibinary system

Extensive studies on the impurity diffusion coefficients of Si in
fccA1 Al have been reported [22-28]. Using the electron micro-
probe analysis, McCaldin et al. [22] measured the impurity diffu-
sion coefficients of Si in wrought Al at temperatures between
633 and 833 K. By means of the Matano-Boltzmann analysis, Bic-
kle [23] investigated the impurity diffusion coefficients of Si in
fcc A1 Al from 743 to 853 K. Using diffusion couple method with
electron probe microanalysis, Fujikawa et al. [24], Bergner et al.
[25]and Fricke [26]determined the impurity diffusion coefficients
of Si in fccA1Alwithin the temperature range of 618-904 K. Beer-
wald [27] et al. and Freche [28] measured the impurity diffusion
coefficients of Si in fccA1 Al via diffusion couple method from
738 to 873 K. The impurity diffusion coefficients of Si in fccA1
Al reported by McCaldin et al. [22], Fujikawa et al. [24], Bergner
et al.[25], Beerwald et al. [27] and Freche et al. [28]are compatible
and have been employed in the present optimization.

Using Matano-Boltzmann method, Fujikawa et al. [24] deter-
mined the interdiffusion coefficients in fccA1 Al-Si alloys from
753 to 873 K within the concentration range from 0 to 0.5 at.S Si,
and the intrinsic diffusion coefficients were extracted with the
Darken relation. Bickle [23] also measured the chemical diffusion
157

the Al-Cu system were taken from the assessment of Chang et al.
[34]. Based on available experimental data about the self-diffusiv-
ity of Cu, Ghosh [35] and Kozeschnik [36] have optimized the
mobility parameters of Cu. The results calculated by Ghosh [35]
and Kozeschnik [36] are in good agreement with each other. How-
ever, more parameters were needed to express the mobility
parameters of Cu in [36]. Thus the mobility parameters of Cu by
Ghosh [35] were adopted in the present work. According to the
published experimental data on the self-diffusion coefficients, the
mobility parameters for fccA1 Al were assessed by Cui et al.
[37], which were recommended by C.E. Campbell [38] during the
recent CALPHAD conference in 2012. The mobility parameters are
directly used in the present work. The calculate temperature
dependence of self-diffusivity of Cu, Al, Si are illustrated in Fig. 1.

In order to perform the assessment of the atomic mobilities in
the fccA1 Cu-Si, Al-Si and Al-Cu-Sialloys, reasonable thermody-
namic parameters are necessary to calculate the thermodynamic
factor. Ansara et al. [39], Yan et al.[40] and Shin et al.[41] reported
the thermodynamic study for the binary Cu-Si alloys based on the
CALPHAD framework, but the modelings from [39,40] did not use
thermochemical data for fccA1 solid solution phases to evaluate
their parameters. Thus the thermodynamic parameters by Shin
et al. [41] were adopted in the present work. The thermodynamic
parameters used for the assessment of the fccA1 Al-Si mobility
parameters are taken directly from Grobner et al. [42], which is
successfully used to assess the Al-Cu-Si system by He et al. [43],
and the thermodynamic description of the Al-Cu-Si system from
them were accepted.

Based on critically reviewed experimental data, the assessment
procedure was performed in the following steps. Firstly, the self-
diffusion coefficients are obtained by using the assumption
[3,15-17] or taken directly from the literature [35,37], Secondly,
the impurity diffusion coefficients are evaluated with the aim to
obtain the mobility end-members. Next, the tracer diffusion,
intrinsic diffusion and interdiffusion coefficients in binary systems
were calculated by using the above-obtained atomic mobilities of
the end-members, and the computed diffusivities are compared
with the corresponding experimental data. In the end, the compu-
coefficients in fccA1 Al-Si alloys by means of Matano-Boltzmann
analysis from 743 to 853 K.The measured intrinsic diffusion coef- tational simulations of compositional profiles in diffusion couples
ficients and interdiffusion coefficients from different sources
[23,24] are in reasonable agreement with each other within exper-
imental error and have been adopted in the present optimization.
Mehl et al. [29] measured the interdiffusion coefficients between
673 and 721 K with the aid of the microprobe analysis technique.
However, the results from Mehl et al. [29] are not consistent with
those of [23,24], and are not utilized in this work.
3.3. The Al-Cu-Si-ternary system

By means of ternary Al-Cu-Si diffusion couples together with
electron probe analyses and micro-hardness checks, Zhang et al. R-
[30] measured the interdiffusion coefficients in the temperature f] -14
range of 753-813K. 2hang et al.[31]also investigated copper dif- S
fusivities in a single phase by diffusion couple experiments. The
main ternary interdiffusion coefficients and cross-interdiffusion
coefficients measured by Zhang et al. [30,31] were used to adjust
the interaction mobility parameters during the assessment proce-
dure. The reported experimental concentration profiles were
adopted to validate the simulated diffusion data yielding from
the assessed mobility parameters.

By means of the least-squares method, Du et al. [44] critically
assessed the impurity diffusion coefficients of 14 elements in fcc
and liquid Al, and obtained a consistent activation energy and
the pre-exponential factor. However, this work shows a small dis-
crepancy from Du et al. [45] due to the experimental data taken
from different researchers. The impurity diffusivity of Si in fccA1
Alwas carefully chosen in order to give a suitable start value of the
interdiffusivity. As we can see in Fig. 8, the calculated impurity dif-

The calculated values of the interdiffusion coefficients generally in-

ternary Al-Cu-Si diffusion couples are compared with the corre-
sponding experimental data [30,31], as shown in Figs. 15-18. As
shown in these figures, the calculated concentration profiles for
different diffusion couples agree well with most of the experimen-
tal data [30,31], but show a some deviation of Si concentration pro-
files at 783 K in Fig. 16. This discrepancy may be due to the
experimental or measuring error as mentioned in the original pa-
per, for a very thin oxidizing film was found in the interface of
investigated diffusion couple.
5. Conclusions

Combining the available thermodynamic and diffusion data
with the CALPHAD approach, the atomic mobilities of Si, Cu and
Al in face-centered cubic Cu-Si, Al-Si and Cu-Al-Si alloys as a
function of temperature and composition have been assessed using
the DICTRA software package. Comprehensive comparisons be-
tween the calculated and measured diffusivities show that most
of the experimental data can be well reproduced by the presently
