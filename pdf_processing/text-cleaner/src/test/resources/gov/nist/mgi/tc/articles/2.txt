changing the crystal structure. Rather than mutually dif-
fusing the previously prepared pure Cr and V dibor1des,
which would require a very high temperature, a CrV alloy was
made and ground to - 325 mesh. The alloy powder was pressed
together with pure boron powder and sintered at 1500%C for
1 hour. Diffusion had progressed about 1/4 of the way into
the center of the alloy grains. Good diffusion results might
be obtained by this method tut the development of extraneous
second phases is still possible.

NMR has again provided us with critical specimen
characterization information. The x-ray diffraction pattern
of one of our ScB., specimens revealed the proper pattern of
lines for ScE,, plus a few additional weak un1dentiried
lines. When this specimen was put into the NMR spectrometer
the characteristic Knight shift for s candium metal was
observed in addition to the Knig;ht shift corresponding to
ScB.,, indicating that the Scf., epecimen was contaminated
with excess scandium metal. Rfter feheating, the sample the
resonance corresponding to elemental s candium metal was
reduced. (Comparre fig. la, showing both resonances before
reheating, with fig. lb, showing only the Sc 1n ScP., reson-
ance. Note that the quadrupole effect 1n the Sc 1n' S3cB-,
resonance remains after the reheating.)
2. Ph sical Pro ert Measurements

Of the bor1de rod specimens that we have acquired thus
far the CrB and CrE., specimens would appear from the metal-
lography, x-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance,
to y1eld meaningful soft x-ray spectra. Some data on the
r,, spectrum and the th order E, spectrum has been obtained
frbm the particular specimens whTch, as of this writing.
perrmit some general features to be compared. The E, th
order spectra from both the CrB and CrB., peak are aE the same
energy and are of the same general width although it is
evident that there are differences in the detailed shape of
the bands. Neither does there seem to be any significant
difference in the Cr,, Deak position between the two com-
pounds. A definitiy8 study of thhe M., soft x-ray spectrum
of pure chromium has been completed.'' Correctons have been
made for background, and sub-band and satellite overlap.
The estimate of the pure Cr,, emission band thus obtained
was compared with recent photoem1sslon data and good
correlation has been found.

We have obtained NMR Knight shift and quadrupole data
on ScE,, which is one of the few diborides upon which no
previofis measurements of such properties have been reported
in the literature. This work has been completed between
room temperature and 4'X. Both the Enight shift and the
quadrupole coupling, constant are the same at both tempera-
tures. This, together with l2newidth measurements, ahows no

Nuclear miagnet1c resonance spectrum of
scandium'5 a: 16 MHz in a sample of
scandium diboride; (a) sample as origi-
nally received, exhibiting a resonance
charracterist1c of elemental s candium
metal, in addition to a resonance
corresponding to Sc in ScBp, and (b)
same sample after reheating and the
elemental sc andiumn metal resonance no
longer discernible. The second order
quadrupole effect present in the Sc in
ScB rresonan2e is seen to remain after
the reheatinX-


indications of magnetic behavior. THs ''y resonance is
mu ch as it is in the other diborides. TThe central lIne
shows a little structure in the middle which does not dis-
appear at higher frequencies (2l MHx). Our past experience
tells us that much of this can be ascrribed to noise arising
from boron in the glass tube and, more importantly, the
probe itself. With these, imitations we find the Enight
shift K = 0.00 (1)geyA ''E, with respect to triethy lborate.
The quadrupole satellites are low in intensity, compared
with, say CrB.,. This would suggest eitherr a poor quality
sample with 1Erge distributions of quadrupole interactions
or the exciting possibil1ty of an appreciable asymmetry
parameter. The latter could have important consequences
for understanding the crystallographic symmetries.

pp,s ''s;A resonances shows strong second order quadru-
pole effects. The value for esqG/h, using second order
quadrupole theory, coincides, gith that observed from the
three pairs of satellites (y'7 - rrA:
- i/ 4 J, and has a value of
6.1(3) MHa. TThe lInewdth of this resonance is propor-
tional to l/v so that the structure is due s1mply to second
S';'2z3 :':22::222'-
structure. The position for v was deduced from the posi-
tion of the centra1 5sc resonSnce 1ine, giving K = +0.07(1)5
at both temperatures. This is in contrast to a negative
Enight shift as observed foH 5ly in VE,, wh1ch has important
implications regarding the electronic htructure.
3. E1ectronic Structure Calculatons

Generally the most sol3d progress is made when there
is a parallel experimental and theoretical effort. Thus far
the only work on borides has been experimental. There have
been no electronic structure calculations on the mono- or
diborides. Meanwhile, to explain experimental results
there has been much discussion in the literature as to
whether electrons are transferred from the metal to the
boron or vice versa, or to the conduction band, etc., with-
out annything being resolved. Therefore to complement the
experimental program, computer routines are being preparred
for augmented plane wave calculation of the band structure
of the hexagonal diborides, XE-,, where X is a transition
metal ion. It is these compoufds which display metallic
properties and high melting points, and are thus possibly
of greatest technical interest. Wh1le these calculations
are simple in principle, certain practical problems are
encountered when studying compounds, and these are further
complicated by the prresennce of transition metal ions, and
the hexagonal lattice structure. The problem is one of
convergence in the reciprocal lattice expansion. The larger
the basis necessary, the lengthier and more expensive w1ll
n thns expression, K0. 00(1)3, the number in parentheses
is the uncertainty in the measurement, and belongs in the last
decimal place given for the quoted value. This expression is
therefore equivalent to K= (0. 00-+. 01) 3.

The new experimental tube described in the last report
has been completed and tested. A1l aspects of the tube
are functioning properly. However, a problem of specimen
contamnation with carbon was encountered. Efforts to
eliminate the problem were begun early in the present
report period, but were temporarily suspended due to sched-

it is hoped to complete at least some of the measurements

3. 2.3. 2. High Temperaturre Creep in Metals
A. A. O. Rukwied, W. A. W1llard and D. E. Harne

Metallurgy D1vision
Institute for Materials Research

The ob,]ectives of this investigatlon are to investi-
g;ate the microscopic me chanisms that control high tempera-
ture creep, J ,e., creep occurring at temperature TxT./,
where Tg, is the me lting point. More specifically it'''1s
planned to study : (a) the effect of temperature on the
creep rate and compare this to the temperrature dependence
of dislocation velocity, (b) the effect of stress and com-
pare this to measurement of d1slocation density carried out
by etch pit techniques, (c) study the effect of stacking
fault energy through its variation in an alloy series and
(d) study the effect of grain boundaries by comparison of
studies in single crystals and poly crystals. Por these
studies copper and copper-alloys have been selected to
begin with especially since etch pit techniques for these
materials are already developed.

In order to get a faster and more accurate evaluation
of the experimental creep data on high purity copper, digi-
tal computer data processing was employed. The second
stage true strain rates were determined using first and
second order least square fitting, techniques. PoY the
derivation of the actiyation energies the slopes of the
Arrhenius plots of Ine,, vs. 1/T (where eg is the second
stage creep rate and T Ehe absolute temperature) also were
determined using linear least square fits.

The resulting value of the apparent activation energy
for second stage creep was G, w 39.5tl kcal/mol

12


(165s4 kJ/mo1) for stress 1evels of 1000 and 1500 psi
(6.89x10' and 10.34x10' N/, respectively), only alightly
less than the previously reported value of 42z 1.5 kcal/mol
(176z6 kJ/mo1). However it turned out that another test
series measured at a stress of 2250 psi (15.5x10f N/m),
the minimum creep rates of which resulted in an apparent
activation energy of 42.4 kcal/mo1 (177 kJ/mol), has to be
considered with great caution with regard to its value of
the apparent activation energy for steady state creep. It
could be shown from the residual curvature of the fitted
parabol1c curves as well as from Andrade-type plotting of
the creep curves (r vs. gJ/5), that in these tests at the
onset of third stage (leading to fracture) steady state
was not quite reached yet.

The apparent activation energy for steady state creep,
Rc is usually assumed to be identical with the thermo-
dynamically defined enthalpy of activation, AH, which is
measured as the temperature sensitivity of the strain rate
at constant stress and structure, i.e.

G, - AE = -R(31Ae72 1/J,, etructure
C1)

Within this definition, correct values of AH are derived
from steady state creep rates only if the structure in
second stage is a function of stress only and is independent
of temperature.

One can hope to get additional information with regard
to this point by employing the differential temperature test
method (AT-method), where the creep rates are measured
immediately before and after a small and rapid change in
test temperature, which does not allow the structure to
change significantly.

Three such AT-tests were carried out on high purity
copper at atresses or 1000, 1500, and 2250 ps1 (6.89 x 1c'
10.3 x 10', and 15.51 x 10- N,/m) and temperatures or 672',
540', and 48gPC, respectively. The temperature was dropped
by about 20C in each case and was measured by a thermocouple
attached to the specimen. The values obtained for AH were
4. 67.5, and 65 kcal/mo1 (297, 283, and 272 RJ/mo1),
respectively. This clearly is at variance with the steady
state measurements in the high temperature regime up to
700'C, where 3S.5 kcal/mol (165 kJ/mo1) was found. It also
cannot be recor.ciled with the measurements of Barrett and
Sherby, who obtained from steady state creep rates values
of AH or 61 kca.l/mo1 (255 kJ/mo1) at temperatures T =600'C,
and or 29.5 kca.l/mo1 (121 kJ/mo1) at 40o3cTc6003C (both


values of AH are computed from their publAshed steady state
strain rate data).

Moreover, in order to get further insight into the
influence on high temperrature creep of the purity of the
test material, the grown-in substructure, and the pre-test
annealing treatment, a test series on OFHC copper (nominal
99.99 Cu) at a stress of 1500 psi (10.3l x 10t N/m) was
started, and a few AT-tests on both types of materials are
being carried out presently. At this time these results
are still inconclusive.

If, however, we apply to our data obtained by the AT-
method the analysis of activation parameters as given by
Schoeck, then we obtain for the high purity copper a value
of the Gibbs free energy, 6G, of 40 kcal/mol (167 1J/mo1).
In computing AG, we have assumed that the rate controlling
process is diffusion, thus having an activation volume of
the order of one atomic volume. In this case in the
relation for AG as given by Schoeck the term involving the
activation volume can be neglected and the entropy contr1-
bution is wholly described by the temperature varriation of
the elastic modulus,

6G = MH - T5S =
MH
1 - (T/u) (du/dT)

The temperature variation of the elastic modulus, l, has
been measured by Barrett and Sherby and by Kster.
(2)

The observed discrepancy of the activation enthalpies,
6H, as derived from the steady state tests (39.5 kcal/mol,
165 kJ/mo1) and from AT-tests (=a 70 kcal/mol, 293 kJ/mo1),
clearly indicates the need to check on the theory and/or
its assumptions.

According to the theorry of therrmally activated dis-
location processes, the activation enthalpy for the rate
controlling process is determined by measuring creep rates
at different test temperatures under conditions of constant
structure. TThe term constant structure means that during
a small change in test temperature, or at different test
temperatures in the case of steady state testing, the number
of defect configurations at which under the action of a
given stress thermal activation of a dislocation segment can
occur does not change. TThe structure, thus comprising all
defect configurations in the body which determine its creep
behavior, gives rise to a long range internal stress in the
body. TThis internal stress depends on temperature through

dation to laser materials has been circumvented by equipment
design or by a cut-and-try improvement in the laser materials.
This problem of optically induced damage now poses a serious
threat to the successful application of 1aser devices to an
important class of needs of the Department of Defense.
This fact has been recognized and the Advanced Research
Projects Ag;ency supports research to improve the performance
of 1aser materials. The convening within the last nine
months of three committees to examine the optical damage to
laser materials illustrates the present concern and impor-
tance of solving this class of problems. These committees
are the Subcommittee TI of ASTM Committee F-1, the Institute
for Defense Analysis study, and the National Materials
Advisory Board Committee on the Fundamentals of Damage in
Laser Glass.

The success of these efforts depends upon having the
knowledge and proper skills available when they are needed.
In the case of laser technology, they include the science
and techniques of 1aser materials preparation and charao-
terization and of the measurement and evaluation of those
properties which are relevant to the damage and degradation
of 1asers. It is the overall ob,je ctive of the present NBS
program on laser materials to identify some of the more
important problems concerning damage and degradation of
lasers and to provide the necessary advances in those areas
for which NBS possesses the competence to do so. TThese
efforts will be directed mainly toward providing the tech-
niques for the preparation and characterization of laser
materials to be used in tests for the measurement and
evaluation of material properties pertinent to the damage
and degradaticn of 1asers, for the tabulation of key damage
data, and for the improvement in the knowledge and sk1lls
necessary to advance the performance of lasers.

In pursuit of this program, a continuing attempt is
being made to analyze the technological problems associated
with high performance lasers and the materials from which
they are constructed, and to distill from th1s analysis
ma,jor scientific problems whose solutions would advance
laser technolcgy. In addition, the problems chosen should
fall within areas in which NBS has available competence.
Also, the number of problems included in the program should
be kept small enough so that each one can be approached
in a reasonably comprehensive manner.

In accordance with these criteria, the present prog;ram
contains three subdivisions - Characteri2ation of Laser
Materials, Damage to Laser Materials, and Degradation of
Laser Materials. Damage and Degradat1on as used here are
distinguished in that Damage is local1zed and occurs during

17


the course of a very few pulses whereas Degradation impl1es
the much more gradual and gennerral deteriorat1on of perfor-
mance over many pulses. There may of course be some over-
lap-

4.3. Overall Summary of Pro,jects on Laser Materiale

4.3.l. Characterisation of Laser Materiale
There is a continuing need for the characterization
of aser materials. Suppllers frequently make changes in
composition and usually do not provide adequate data on
those physical and chemical propert1es which influence
laser performance and the distortion of wave fronts propa-
gating in laser materials. The Index of refraction, thermal
change in the refractive index, elastic constants, photo-
elastic constants, thermal expansion, density, and
chemical compostion have been measured for five commercial
Nd-doped laser glasses. The possibility of eliminating
electrostrictive effects by ludiciously altering the glass
composition has been examined. A l1thium-s1l1cate laser
glass whose composition approximates that of some commer-
cially available laser glasses was found to have a consolute
temperature between 4l0PC and l80PC. Since the consolute
temperature occurs near the transformation region, a large
degree of phase separation may occur during anneal1ng.
Other compos1tions will be examined in the future. The
relation between phase separation and the performance of
a laser is not understood very well and could require
quantitative studles if one can show that phase separated
g;lasses have consistently lower or higher tolerances to
damage or degradation. X-ray diffraction techniques have
been employed to characterize ruby laser rods and a correl-
ationn between crystal perfection and its performance in a
laser has been considered.

4.3. 2. Damage to Laser Materials
Inclusion damage (bulk) has been a serious source of
difficulty for the laser systems engineer concerned with
ultra-high power pulses. Although surface damage and
intrinsic damage (self-focusing or beam trapping) contribute
additional problems, these are at present apparently not as
g;reat an obstacle to the advance of laser technology as the
inclusion damage is. A laser glass damage test facility is
being constructed at NBS to study the damage problem and to
attempt to bring some unity to the great proliferation of

18


damage data. Th1s test facil1ty w1ll center arouund a one
gJg,awatt neodymium laser system. Preliminary experiments
on the damage of sil1ca and g;lass samples by exposure to a
G-switched ruby laser pulse of poules studied the variation
of damage threshold with water content. These experiments
also indicate that knowing the samples' total h1story is
essential for interpreting and understanding the results of
damage studies. The detection of incip1ent absorbing centers
before they im1tiate a damage site would be most helpful in
the chemical analysis of the site and 1ts 1mmediate neighbor-
hood. Some ideas to detect incip1ent damage centers have
been screened in a search for useful analytic methods.
These include dielectr1c relaxation, nuclear magnetic reson-
ance, azimutha.1 1ight scattering, forward light scattering,
and 1nfra-red detection techniques. Nonne appear suff1ciently
promising to pursue at th1s t1me for the detection of
inclusions leading to damage. Methods which employ optical
interference or stress-birefringence principles have aleo
been sug;gestec:. A theoretical model of an absorb1ng center
in a laser glass host has been formulated. This model
enables one to compute the space and time dependence of
the temperature near the center, the thermal stress, and the
stress-birefringence as functions of the laser pulse width,
energy content of the laser pulse, and radius of the absorb-
ing center. Prelminary computations indicate that su ch
optical methods are prom1sing.

..3.5. Degradation of Laser Materiale
At present, the coloration of some ruby and YAG laser
rods after continued use is not well understood. The reasons
are in part a lack of sufficient data on the differences
among coloratt.on by laser pump light, x-ray irradiationn, and
Y-ray irradlation. The causes responsible for degrradation
in performance of s olid state lasers after continued use
have been studied by electron paramaghetic resonnance and by
optical means. Good laser quality ruby and ''orange'' degraded
ruby samples were examined by both their absorption spectra
and their electron paramagnetic resonance. Alsc, particular
attenntion has been given to the valence states of the
chromium ions, magnesium ions in doubly doped rubies, and
of impurity ions. Similar studies are planned for YAG
cry stals.

The results obtained are shown in Table 1. A1l results
are in ppm of the element except the Cr results which are
reported as percent Cr-V - The improved ratio of thermal
to fast neutrons in the rew irradiation fac1lity resulted
in a reduction of a.lmost an orger of rEg'tude in the 4'NA
production from the reaction 'A1(n,cJ ;,Na . Z2he mgasure-
ment,,oof short-11ved activities such as '''cu, wa, Mn,
I 4- A

and P 's;A was thus made much more reliable. An upper limit
for Na in the crystals is reported which takes into account
the Na produced from the Al matrix. Because of inter-
ferences, the values for W 1n the table should probably be
regarded as upper limits rather than f1rm concentrat1ons.
For the crystals containing nominally 0. 033 and 0. 064S
Crp;, two ad,iacent samples were cut from each boule and in
each case the sample designated Vl was from the wider end
of the crystal.

(2) Neodymium-doped Laser Glasses - Five commercially-
made specimens of neodymium-doped laser glasses were analy zed
by neutron activationn methods, with particular care taken
to deterrmine trace impurities.

These glasses are very complex mixtures, containing
in some cases as many as ten principal constituents. Por
activation analysis the constituents representing the most
serious interferences to the measurement of other activities
are sodium, antimony (17 or more in 4 of the glasses), and
neodymium (3-55). The neodymium is especially aggravating
since on irradiation it yieldg three radionucl1des : 15lNd,
with., 4., 1R minute halr-11re; 4'SNd, wi;h., a 1.5 hour halr-1ire;
and ' /Nd with an 11 day half-life. ' Nd and 19Nd also
decay to form radioisotopes of promethium with half-l1ves
or 28 hours and 53 hours.

To try to obtain the maximum amount of information with
a reasonable expenditure of effort three sets of irradiations
were carried out. Por each of the glasses a small sample
(10-50 mg) was irradiated for 2 seconds and used to determine
Na, K, and Sb. A larger sample (100-2200 mg;) of each glass
was irradiated for 1 minute, and dissolved in HF-HC10,-
After fuming to eliminate HF, the residue was taken up in
GN HCl and most of the antimony was removed by extraction
into isopropyl ether. Sodium was then removed by passing
the aqueous phase through a column of hy drated antimony
pentoxide. The effluennt was examined for 1ow-level consti-
tuents of intermediate half-life. Those observed included
La, Pr, Eu, and Sm. Common impurit1es such as copper and
gallium were not observed.

A third set of samples (100-200 mg) was irradiated for
15 minutes and set aside for two weeks to allow all shorter-

22


lived activities to decay away. After dissolution and
extraction of antimony as before the aqueous phase was
counted and Nd, Ce, and Ba were determined (Glass E d1d not
require these chemical separations since it had very Iow
concentrations of Na and Sb).

A11 the samples were irradiated in the NBS Reactor at
a flux of about 6 x 2045 A/cm'sec. The maximum, 1rradiation
pige-sample., 4lze combination was fixed by the 4'Na, 17CSE -
r'Sb, and '' Nd activities produced. A1l the samples were
specially cut l-mm thick slices. With samples this thin,
neutron self-shielding was not a problem even for Glass E
with 14 Lia9. For this 1atter glass irradiation time was
not limited by Na or Sb because these were quite Iow, but
by Nd and by heating of the sample during irradiat;on by
absorption of alpha part1cles from the reaction: PL1 (n,c)
5g. A11 the samples were rinsed in acetone and in dilute
HNO after irradiation to remove surface contamination. In
mosf cases concentrations were determined by comparison to
standards irradiated under the same conditions.

Results: The results obtained are given in Table 2.
The relative standard deviation is estimated to be about
1%S in most cases. Por the lower reported values of Sm
there is severe interference from Nd and these values are
probably no better than i205. Por the Jower reporrted values
for Eu and Ce the signal-to-background ratio was poor and
these values also are probably no better than :205. A11
results are reported as the oxide rather than the element to
facilitate comparison with results from other methods.

etrictive ErfesEk

Several mechannisms for the cause of damage in laser
materials have been considered during this period. In some
of these me chanisms the effect is greatly enhanced by the
presence of electrostrictive self-focusing,s, which lead to
the formation of filaments. Chiao, Townes and Stoicheff
u J have pointed out that electrostrictive pressure is given
by

p = (E''/4) n (p on/do),
(1)

where E is the electric field, p the density of the material
and n the refractive index. In addition, Chiao, Garmire
and Townes [ 2 have shown that the refractive index changes
due to the cha.nge in density caused by electrostriction are

where B is the compressibility. It is obvious from equations
(1) and (2) that the ele ctrostrictive pressure w1ll be zero
and the change in index w1ll be zero 1f (p dn/dp) = 0. The
possibility of finding a material which w1ll meet this con-
dition has been studied, and the results are presented in
this section cf the report.

Data on (p dn/dp) for various cubic crystals are avail-
able from stucies conducted at NBS [ 3] and other laboratories
[ 4,5J and these data are prresented in Table 3. It can be
seen that there is a considerable range in values of
(p dn/dp) fron +1.31 for PbN0 to - 2. 84 ror GaAs. Por the
group of alkali halides there is a decrease in magnitude of
(p dn/dp) with increasing strength of Interatom1c binding.
There are several crystals which have negative values of
(p dn/dp). With these crystals the refractive index becomes
less under hy drostatic pressure because the decrease in
polariaability of the constituent ions outweighs the positive
contribution to index due to the increased number of scatter-
ing centers per unit volume [3,41.

In Table 3, it can be seen that YAG (Yttrium Aluminum
Garnet) has a slightly negative value and verry nearly ful-
f1lls the condition that (o dn/dp) = 0. A boule of undoped
YAG has been obtaired from Union Carbide Corporation, and
1t is planned to study the effect of high energy laser
pulses upon the material. If equations (1) and (2) are
correct, electrostrictive effects should be largely e limi-
nated.

A1though YAG is a promising material, the rod of a high
energy pulsed laser will almost certainly have to be a glass,
because the broad fluorescent line of a glassy host lends
itself to G-switching. In Table 4 values of (o dn/dp) arre
given for several glasses. The first group shows values
for 5 neodymium doped laser glasses which have been studied
recently at N1S. The values are clustered closely around
0.3, although the Owens-Illinois glass has a slightly
lower value, 0. 30. The second group of 10 glasses were
selected as being representative of 154 Schott glasses
reported in a verry thorough study by Schaeffer and Nassen-
stein [6]. The highest value is .77 foF SFS1 and the lowest
value is . 2l for SSK8. In the third group are shown the
results of experimental studies onn simple glass compositions
conducted at NBS. Asp5 has very high value of 2.3, and

the calcium aluminate, F75, has a value of .19 which is
significantly lower than the rest. The low value of
(p dn/dp) for the calcium aluminate glass (which contained
41.5 weight3 A1a) 1s consistent with the fact that with
applled hydrostatIc pressure, crystalline A)-. (sapphire)
exhibits a decrease in refractive index for Both the
ordinary and e xtraordinary ray L ( i

Considering the fact there is a consistent trend toward
negative values of ( dn/d) with incrreasing strenngth of
interatom1c binding for the group of alkali hal1des shown
in Table S, it 1s reasonable to assume that a similar trend
holds for the series of a.lkaline earth oxides. It can be
seen in Table 3 that Mg;0 has a negative value of (p dn/dp)
so that substituting; Mg;0 for Ca0 in the calcium aluminate
composition of F7 might be expected to reduce the value
of (o dn/dp) to one closer to zero. Moreover, according to
the physical theory of photoelasticity, certain ions such
as Est and F' 1f s ubstituted cou 1d be expected to make an
even stronger negative contribution to (p dn/dp) [ 4]. The
electron1c polarizability and binding strengths of the
constituent ions are the important factors, and 1t should
be possible to formulate s ome glass composition where
(p dn/dp) would equal zero.

In conclusion, it should be noted that the basic mater-
ial parameters which describe the interraction between
optical radiation and acoustic waves are Pockels ' elasto-
optic constants [ ,E,3J. One of the mechanisms that have
been proposed as the cause for laser damage in solid,
transparent d:.electrics is the generation of coherent
ultrasonic phonons by stimulated Brillouin processes I..,20J.
Chiao, Townes and Stoicheff [1l have pointed out that
either compressional or shear waves may be excited, but
for compression the coupling between acoustic and optical
waves is simpilest and may be described as electrostriction.
Inn this case, equation (1) still holds. Chiao, Townnes and
Sto1cheff have shown that, when the radiation is contained
in a resonant cavity, the threshold condition for buildup
of the acoustic and scattered wave is

Three ruby boules, doped at nominal levels of 0. 05,
0. 05 and 0. 06l5 of Cr0, respectively, were furnished by a
commercial supplier. T5e crystallographic directions in
the boules were determined by x-ray methods and prisms of
known orientation were prepared for the refractive index
measurements. The results are shown in Table 5.

Specimens cut from the same boules were analy zed by
neutron activa.tion methods and the results are given in
Table l. As may be seen from the table the boules contain-
ing nominal levels of 0. 055 and 0.064S Cr-,0 were found to
contain essentially the same amounts of CY0g. The
refractive incex values in Table 5 do not disagree with
the analyses. The variations in refractive index for all
three boules a.re only one or two in the fourth decimal.

When these measurements were planned it was expected
that data would be obtained to allow the calculation of
the channge in refractive index produced by a change in the
Cra0; concentration. Since the observed changes are so
small no meaningful calculation can be made.

A comparison of these data with data reported in the
literature on sapphire L....l and on ruby [ 12] show variations
of two or less in the fourth decimal so that specimens
containing appreciably more Cr0a would be required to
determine the effect of CrA0 concentration on refractive
index.

This glass composition has a consolute temperature between
441'C and 4485C, a temperature range close to its annealing
point (approx. 460C). Such results imply that a degree of
microstructure will appear in the glass when it is heat-
treated at temperatures below annd around 4 l0P. The degree
and size of the microstructure will then increase with the
length of heat treatment. Since the consolute temperature
occurs in the transformation region of this glass, a large
degree of phase separat1on may (is likely to) oc cur during
anneallng.

.4.1.5. An X-ray Transmission Method for

Ob,ective
Examining Ruby Laser Rods
E. N. Farabaugh and F. A. Mauer
Inorganic Materiale Division
Institute for Materials Research

This study was undertaken to determine whether x-ray
diffraction techniques may be used to characterize ruby
laser rods. A correlation between crystal perfection and
laser performance is being considered.
Approach and Results

Work has continued onn the correlation of laser crystal
perfection, as determined by x-ray diffraction techniques,
and laser performance.

Since the last reporting period annother group of laser
rods has been examined using a modified high voltage trans-
mission technique developed during this reporting period.
The general features are shown in Figure 1. A slit, llmm
by lmm has been placed a distance of 10cm from the x-ray
source and the film placed parallel to the x-ray beam.

32


Pictures are taken at several points along the lenngth of
each rod. The beam samples a d1sc-shaped volume of the
rod and produces an array of diffraction spots each of
which is a crJde x-ray topograph of the cross section (fig.
2).

The most recently examined group of three ruby laser
rods was again obtained from Dr. J. Ha11 (NBS, Boulder).
These rods all have better laser performance than the first
group. Rod D, . 530 in. in diameter by 3. 0 1n. long with
rod axis parallel to =01107, has residual strain and is
described as ''definitely inferior to rods E and F'' by Hall.
Rod E, 3/8 in. 1n diameter by 1 1/22 n. Jong with its axis
parallel to 40l107, was described by Hall as being the best
rod for laser performance that he has seen. Rod F, a 609
rod . 620 in. in diameter by 3 11/16 in. l ong, was descrlbed
as typical of the best available currently. This rod has
some tracking damage. Al rods are' still capable of the
laser performance described above.

Figure 3 1s a composite of corresponding spots from
five f1lms taken along the length of rod D. These topo-
g;raphs show how the crystal perfection of the rod varies
along its length. The best volumes of the rod are repre-
sented by those images of the cross section which are free
of distortion and have a minimum of splitting. A wide
range of crystal perfection is indicated by these films.
Rod D was descr1bed by Hall as having some straln present
which affected its angular distribution pattern. The
topographic method used is not sensitive to strain and the
films do not indicate th1s characteristic of the rod.

Figure 4 is a composite of corrresponding spots from
f1ve films taken along the Iength of rod E, the ''best''
laser rod. These films also ind1cate a range of crystal
perfection along the length of the rrod. When this rod was
examined under crossed polarrizers, it was observed that it
did not exhibit extinction uniformly across its cross
sectional area (Hall was aware of this before sending the
rod to us). The s ubgrains in the rod appear to run from
end to end and are fairly regular. Thus, it is ev1dent
that 62hY rod can have very good laser performance and
2k. not be yery goo9srystallographically . In comparing
the films of rods D and E 1t is seen that f1lms are in
general very similar, however, the laser performance of
rod E is superior to that of rod D.

Pilms were also taken along rod F. None of these films
are pictured because the images formed were very weak. The
faintness of the diffraction images is due to the fact that

in this rod we are approaching the 1imiting; th1ckness of
ruby rod that we can get an x-ray beam through. Inspection
of these films showed spots which were well formed in
every film with a minimum of splitting and distortion.
Since all of the films were of the same quality we would
evaluate this rod as better crystallographically than rod E.
The laser performance is however, inferior to that of rod E.
Rod F was described as possessing some tracking; damage.
Although our images are weak and not many spots appear,
there is no evidence for this damage observable in the
images.

The rods studied in the previous reporting period
were re-examined using the new technique of topographing
whole cross sectional areas. The results were in good
ag;reement with the previous results and the performance
could be correlated with the crystal perfection.

A badly camaged rod with bubbles, visible to the eye,
was also examined with the modified transmission technique.
The images formed gave no obvious indication that the bubble
defects were present.

It has been demonstrated that the modified transmission
Laue technique can detect misorientations in large single
crystals. However, topographs of the cross section of the
rods do not seem to be sensitive to defects other than grain
boundaries, which are easily demonstrrated. The f1rst set of
rods examined showed a correlation between the laser perform-
ance and cryst al perfection. There was no similar correla-
tion found with the second set of rods.

A possib'.e different view of the problem which might be
more fruitful is not to determine how many imperfections are
shown in the topogrraphs but to try to determine what are the
features in the topographs we obtain which are important in
the grading o:T the crystals for 1aser applications.

Th1s was to set up a well defined laser glass damage
facil1ty for evaluating the damage threshold for various

37


samples of glass and elucidating the me chanisms responsible
for the damage.
Approach

On establ1shing the facility, it will be used to,
(1) measure the damage thresholds for various samples of
glass, (2) catalog the different types of damage observed,
(3) correlate the nature of the damage with the connditions
under which the damage occurred and with the composit1on
and heat treatment, etc. of the glass sample, and, (4)
elucidate the mechanisms responsible for each type of
damage.
EEEE2s

A ''one gigawatt'' neodymium laser system, capable of
producing 20 ns. G-sw1tched pulses with energies in
excess of 30 joules per pulse has been ordered and delivered.

The system consists of an oscillator, -sw1tched by
means of a Pockel's cell, feeding into two successive
amplifier rods, and is currently undergoing acceptance
tests.

Pending the operation of the above system, preliminary
experiments on the damage of silica and glass samples by
exposure to 3 ,joules, G-switched, ruby laser pulses were
undertaken.
Introduction

Bulk physical properties of glass samples indicated
that the threshold for me chanical fracture decreased sub-
stantially as the water content was increased. This
suggested that the threshold for damage by laser pulses
might also be a function of the water content of the glass.

S1nce samples of sil1ca with two distinctly different
waterr contents Ias measured by infra-red absorption, Fig-
ures (1) and (2)] were available, the above investigation
was centered on these samples.
Ex erimental Procedure

The damage threshold of each sample was determined by
changing the rad1ant flux density photons per square centimeter
per second incident on it by moving a thin plate of the sample
along the axis of a convergent, pulsed, laser beam.

The latter was generated by placing a biconvex lens
with a focal length of 2 cms in close proximity to

the ruby laser . The radius of the beam emerging from the
lens was measured at several points along the beam axis
by 1ts ''printing'' effect on black pvc adhesive tape. The
resulting beam profile was as shown in Figure (3).

Wh1le it was recognized that th1s way of def1ning the
beam prof1le was limited by the threshold for the printing
effect, it proved to be fast and reproducible so that the
data could easily be reduced to the low power peripheral
contours which would be observable with a sutable photo-
detector.

The total energy in a single pulse emerging from the
lens was measured with a calibrated solid state calorimeter
placed near the lers. The resulting measurement was
correlated with the signal generated by an TTT bi-planar
photo diode having an S1 spectral response, reacting to
a fraction of the light beam reflected from a glass plate
aatinig as a boam spl1tter as shown in Figure (4).

The corre.lation was carried out by using 10 successive
shots, and these measurements showed that an ITT photo
detector signal of 20 t17 volts corresponded to pulsed
beam energ1es of 1. 5 20.l Joules.

The TTT detector was therefore used as a sensitive
monitor for each flash of the laser used in our damage
studies.

In measurlng damage thresholds, the laser controls
were ad,justed so as to keep the monitor signals to within
250 s 17 volts and results obtained w1th monitor signals
outside of that range were discarded.
3LLLs

Neglecting refractive index and absorption e ffects, the
results of our measurements and the damage threshold for
silica samples with high and low water contents, together
with that for a sample of Calcium Aluminate F7 are summa-
rized in Table 1 and showed that:

(1) All the damage observed was restricted to the
surface and was in the form of surface pitting.

(2) The cnset of damage was accompanied by an
acoustical signal and a flash or ''white'' 1ig;ht.

(3) Different samples, cut from the same slug gave
damage thresholds which were reproducible to w1thin 2. 5
J/cme/0 ns.

(l) SS1lica samples with the higher water content
yielded a higher damage threshold than those having a lower
water content.
E3ssuss3sE

Samples of high water content silica derived from
sources l and 2, of allegedly identical materrial showed very
different damage thresholds, 1.e . 12.5 and 26.5 J/cmF for 30 ns
pulses. These two sets of samples could have had different surface
polishing treatments and they were therefore both re-ground
and re-polished by identical processes to ensure identical
surface characteristics. However, the re-polished samples
still showed the above difference in damage threshold, the
cause of which is not understood.

Another factor of connsiderable interest was that, even
after re-grinding and re-polishing, the high water content
samples invariably damaged on the back surface where the
energy density would be expected to be larger, while the 1ow
water content silica samples invariably damaged on the
upstream surface.

The reason for this difference is not understood, and
may be related to absorption effects in the samples.

Li ht Scatterin Ex eriments

Azimuthal and forward light scattering te chniques have
been sug;g;ested as possible ways to detect such centers.
Two Nd-glass rods (Owens-Illinois ED-2, 2.54 cm in diameter
by 5. 0B cm in length) have been examined in such 1ight
scattering experiments at NBS and at the Air Porce Cambridge
Research Laboratories. The ob,]ect is to see whether
differences between the two rods can be detected by
scattering methods which do not rely upon the human eye
and yet provide an examination of essentially the whole
rod. The search and seek ability of the human eye is very
advantageous when compared with the limitations of such
devices as photo multipl1er tubes and photo-diodes. One
sample was rated excellent and the other sample was rated
as less than excellent but not poor either. The rating,s
were given by H. A. Lee of Owens-Illinois.

The azimuthal light s cattering measurements were
performed at NBS and were reporrted 1n NBS Technical Note
Number 514. These measurements indicated that the forward
scattering might be more fruitful. Dr. Martin Stickley
and Mr. Edmund Hoell agreed to perform small angle scatter-
ing measurements on the above two samples. Their results
were communicated to NBS in the form of a letter. A copy
of the letter and data is g1ven with their perm1ssion in
the appendix to this pro,ject report. We thank them very
much for their cooperation and for the1r efforts in measur-
ing the small angle scattering. Even though they can
distinguish rod A from rod B, the difference is marginal
for the detection of a small number of inclusions wh1ch
are less than tens of microns in size. The technique does
not seem feasible as a way to maintain quality control for
inclusions leading to damage. The technique does have
promise for detecting striae however.
Theoretical Treatment of Laser-Induced Thermal Disturbance
Near Inclusions

The heat diffusion equation with time dependent boundary
conditions is solved for the temperature as a function of
position and time. The optical path length change for a
light ray passing near the inclusion, the radial and
tangjential components of the stress tensor, and the radial
and tangential changes of the local index of refraction due
to the thermal stress field are computed from a knowledg,e
of the space and time variations of the temperature.

are 1ess than ;e'' A. The magnitudes of the tangential,
and radial stress components do not exceed ;g-V (dynes/cm' ).
The maximum stress occurs at the end of the laser pulse
and 1s a factor of 10 less than the bulk moduli of the laser
glass. The magnitudes of the radial and tangential changes
of the index of refract1on due to thermal stress birefring-
ence do not exceed 10-5 , The latter values are greatest
for the same values of radial distance and time as those
for the maximum optical path length change. The maximum
temperature at the 1nterface between the platinum and the
glass is 611'C and occurs at the end of the laser pulse.
The maximum value of expansion of the platinum sphere occurs
during the laser pulse and is about a factor of 1, 000 less
than the speed of sounnd in glass.
Conclusions

The above calculations suggest two possible methods by
which incipient absorbing centers might be detected. One
method would use the interference of two light rays which
experience different optical path length changes and the
other method would use thermal stress birefringence. Because
optical path length changes greater than one tenth the
wavelength of the probing light are required to produce
detectable fringe shifts, case l and case 2 ind1cate
marginal feasibility for either of the above methods. How-
ever, calculations such as case l and case 2 and preliminary
additional calculations, wh1ch apply to millisecond pulse
widths but are not reported here, suggest the direction in
which one should go to optim1ze the optical path length
changes without causing damage . Heating the 1nclus1on
over a long,er period of time to the same surface tempera-
ture of about 600'C gives greater spatial extents to the
changes in indices of refraction. Another approach is to
employ pulse widths and observation times which are less
than the relaxation times of the host. Relaxation times
for laser glasses between 800'C and 1100'C are approximately
between nanioseconds and microseconnds. These are estimates
of the time during which stress is proportlonal to strain
in glasses which are not elastic for infin1te time. Such
short time observations will permit one to raise the inclu-
slon surface temperature substantially above the present
600'C reported here annd st1l1 satisfy the assumptions of
the present model. The author plans to extend his calcula-
tions to longer pulse widths and to higher temperatures.

Most of the other optical methods that have been sug-
gested are capable of examining only small volumes at
any one time and additional scanning methods are essential
if an entire eample is to be studied. For example, K. Vedam

u8


et al, Appl. Phys.
2L. 2551 (1966), report uitramicro-

scoplc techniques by which they illuminate a 20p thick
layer and by which they can detect 0.3'p particles with a
(1/32) sec exposure for the camera. They also have
estimated that 0. 03; particles might be detected with one
hour exposure. The ma,jor disadvantage is that the layer
under observation must be less than about 2 cm from the
surface of the sample. Researchers should be able to
examine much larger volumes of the sample by the techniques
considered in this report.

The above computations suggest that examining incipient
absorbing, centers in laser glasses by methods which employ
thermal stress birefringence are more promising than methods
which use the interference of two l1ght rays which exper1-
ence different optical path length changes due to the local
variation of the index of refraction near the platinum
sphere. However, because the propagation of light in the
presence of a stress birefringence which has spherical
symmetry is ccmplex, the interpretation of the birefring-
ence data will be more tedious than the interpretation
of data from an interference method.

Additional computations suggest that the use of laser
pulses with pv.lse widths of the order of milliseconds may
be more promising for the detection of small incipient
absorbing centers. The longer pulses produce changes in
the index of refraction which extend over greater d1stances.

The present theoretical model can be appl2ed to any
spherical inclusion which has a thermal conductivity g,reater
than that of the host. For example, antimony inclusions.
which have been detected in some laser glasses, can be
treated readily within the framework of the present model.
Applying the present model to this and other cases is
planned. In addition, attempts w1ll be made to remove
some assumptions ccntained in the present model in order
to make it appl1cab.le to a widerr class of problems. Some
researchers suggest that metallic inclusions at very high
temperatures m)ay have thermal conductivities comparable to
that of the host. Por this reasonn, it would be most useful
to remove the restriction that the thermal conductivity
of the inclus'.on be greater than that of the host. Computa-
tionally feastble solutions do not exist at present for
this more general case; but additional e fforts to this end
might prove successful. Also, the degree of thermal
contact between an inclusion and the host should be
examined during and after the laser pulse. It is certain
that the state of thermal contact at the 1nitiation of the
laser pulse depends upon the past thermal history of the

The solution for the temperature is obtained by taking
the Laplace transform of the diffusion equation, the initial
condition, and the time dependent boundary conditions. The
transformed equations become linear equations for the Laplace
transform U(g,3) or the temperature T(r,t). The analytic
properties of the Laplace transform U(r,S) for complex
values of S gives rise to three distinct types of behavior
ror T(2,t). The volume specific heat ratio (R = h,/3hg,)
determines the three regions of behavior; namely R = l,
R s 1, and R = 1. This ratio is about 2. 97 for plat1num
in 1aser glasses. Por this case the function 1/U(r,5) has
zeros at two complex values of ,%Asib. The Bromwich
contour integral is evaluated to give the temperature
rp f
-L 4) from a knowledge of U(y,5).

Having thus obtained the temperaturre T(r,t) onne may
compute all the other quantities discussed above. The
optical path length change AL becomes

ar f, (an/eT) T(r,c) x.
(5)

where the integration is along a ray that has a distance of
closest approach r, to the absorbing center and the varia-
tion of the index 6f refraction wth temperature is (dn/dT).

The calculation of the stress components requ1re a few
more assumptions. The stress components satisfy second
order differential equations in position for a given time
annd hence two coefficients must be determined. The
boundary condition that all stress components vanish at
distances infin1tely far from the absorbing center determines
one of the two coefficients. There are three possible sets
of addit1onal interface boundary conditions from which the
second coefficient may be evaluated. The author has chosen
to employ a slippery boundary at v r,F. A slippery
boundary obtaIns when the conditions 2Tsted below are valid:

52


a. The hydrostatic pressure 1n the absorbing center at
= = 5 equals the radial stress component in the host at
A A
x - r,5.

b. The tangential stress components are discontinuous
across the boundary at r =
A C)

Given conditions a and b, one uses the poisson ratio
and the Young's modulus for the host and the isothermal
compressibility of the absorbing center to compute the
second coefficient. This second coefficient and the tempera-
ture T(g,t) then yield the rradial and tangential stress
components and the radial rates of expansion and contraction
of the absorbing, center. From a knowledg;e of the stress
components the stress birefringence may be computed. T5
the rates of expansion and contraction of the absorbing
center approach the speed of sound in the host then the
above problem becomes a nonnlinear one involving two coupled
differential equations. One equation treats heat diffusion
and the other treats energy transfer In the form of sound
or shock waves.

The author developed an extensive computer program to
evaluate all quantities given in Cases l annd 2 for all
possible values of the ratio 0 = R = M, where M may be
large but finite.

Dear Herb,
23 December 1969

Enclosed are graphs of the scatter loss vs. full angle for
Owens-Illinois Rods A and B. Also included is the data after
reduction by use of the formula found on the glossy figure
(AFCRL photo 109-344).

I think the system for measuring this scatter loss has been
As.
V3s

working as well as it ever will be; to do better than we have done
would require a greater effort than I am willing to put into the
project. For full angles greater than 0. 35 milliradians the
standard deviation turned out to be about 0. 8% or less which
when converted into a loss coefficient gives a standard deviation
of about 0.001crn'l,

As you can see from the graph of the average for 10 runs on
Rod B, the loss is extremely low. I do not know how much of
this loss could be due to small angle surface scatter, thus it is
included in these results. For the sake of computing a loss
coefficient I did not attempt to subtract out a representative
amount for it however. As you can see from the error bars,
the loss is about zero, however the averages for the 10 readings
were still on the positive side of zero for the largest angles
(1. 6 and 0. 8 mrad) where the data is usually the most reliable.
The uncertainty gets quite high at low angles (1. 6 x 10-t radians)
probably because the intensity of the gas laser beam is highest
right in the center, and any error in replacing the aperture will
show up readily.

A comparison of rods A and B shows that the average
transmission of Rod B is equal to or higher than that for
Rod A in every case even though the error bars overlap.
One factor that could cause this would be the optical quality
of the samples. We did position the beam so that it went
through the regicn of best quality of each rod, and to our
eye they looked the same, but whether this measurement
is more sensitive than our eye is unknown to me at the
present time. Thus, if this factor is negligible, I would say
Rod B is better than Rod A, but this difference is so slight
that it is unimportant in the operation of the material as a
laser. I am also enclosing photographs (positives and negatives)
of the intensity distribution in the far field for both rods and for
the case whxre no rod is present. The negatives can be used
for making more prints if you so desire. The far field distribution
is not what would be predicted theoretically since the illumination
of the 4. 2 mm aperture was Gaussian-like.

I am going to send Haynes Lee a copy of this letter plus
attachments since I suspect he is interested in these results
too. We would a.lso be interested in finding out which of these
rods is the better one. Ed Hoell, the person who made the
measurements, thinks Rod B is and the data supports his feeling.
Also, he is due credit for making these measurements. It is due
to his persistence and conscienciousness that they came out as well
as they did. I hpe these results will be of use to you in your laser
glass program.
Sincerely,

In this sense of providing support for the strategy for
the development of needed materials, the present program has
come to focus upon two problem areas, Diffusion in Oxides,
and Properties of Laser Materials. The ARPA support for the
other areas listed in the Table of Contents in this Report
is being phased out, and will for the most part cease with
the present reporting period, although the work on Properties
of Refractory Borides, which is included in a separate propo-
sal to ARPA, may be continued for another six months.

3. HIGE TEMPERATURE MATERTALS PROGRAM
3.l. Ob,jectives inn Hig;h Temperature Materials
The operation of rocket and ,jet enngines involves exposing
metals at high temperatures to oxidising conditions, and
raises the problem of oxidation protection of high tempera-
ture refractory metal structural components. This same
problem, currently for superalloy turbine blades, is posed
again by ,Jet engines. The oxidation protection of metals
requires some form of barrier layer to prevent diffusion.
This layer, either applied or developed by the early stages
of oxidation itself, w1ll moat likely be an oxide, and wi11
function to keep the metal and oxygen apart. Tt can work
only if the diffusion rates of oxygen and metal atoms through
the layer are small enough. Thus the strategy for the
development of oxidation protection of otherwise susceptible
metals at high temperatures w1ll depend in part on being
able to control the rates of diffusion, and therefore, in
having data on the diffusion rates themselves.

Diffusion in oxides is importannt to other classes of
DoD problems. Thus improvements in the reliability and
efficiency of military communication, computer, and radar
circuitry could be made if ceramic magnetic and ferroelectric
components could be made more reproducible and reliable.
Because such important properties as initial susceptibility
and coercive force of ferrites, and dielectric and peizo-
electr1c propertles of ceramic ferroelectr1cs are very
sensitive to the microstructural features (porosity, g;rain
size) controlled by sintering, the strategy for improvement
here requlres control over slntering, in these ceramics. The
same is true of the ballistic response of c eramic armor.
The development of transparent armor requres new techn1ques
for the suppression of g;rain growth durIng otherwise complete
eintering, mainly of 4-

4.4.3. Degradation of L.aser Materials

Ob 'ective
Inorganic Materials D1vision
Inst1tute for Materials Researrch

Th1s investigation is a study of the causes responsible
for degradation of performannce of solid state lasers. The
effort has been directed largely to a study of orange
degradation of laser ruby, by EPR and optical means. (See
NBS Technical Note 51l for previous report).
Technical A EEE2

Procedures followed are a continuation of those followed
previously with the incorporation of appropriate addit1ons
and changes. Experimental measurements consist largely of
optical absorption spectra and electronn paramagnetic reso-
nance on a variety of specially prepared ''ruby'' samples:

l. Deta1led spectra taken on undamaged ruby is
compared with corresponding spectra on ''orange'' degraded
samples. These include specially prepared ''ruby'' as we ll
as ''laser quality'' material.

2. Spectra will be examined for evidence of trace
impurities, ard, in the case or ''orange'' ruby, typical EPR
crystal defect spectra that correlates with the orange
coloring bands. This is of particular interest in view
of the sg;gestion of Stickley, et al . u 4. that disc olor-
ationn may arise from color centers created by the pumping;
light at defects initially present in the crystals.

Special attent1on w1ll be given to the dete ction
of cg-'t and/or Co' 1ons that may exist in the orange
samples. Thh1s effort includes a study of thhe Am = 2, EPR
transition reported by Hoskins and Sorrer and by Mason
and Thorp. I3..

4. A number of doped sapphire crystals are grown and
studied. Included are: rubies covering a wide rannge of
Cr concenntration; crystals containing; other single metal
impurities; and several ''double doped'' with Cr and one
other metal.

5. Most crystals.are colored by radiation with 50 EV
x-rays, but recently =co y-irradiation has been occasionally
employ ed.

Crs04) lies well down the curve at 0.04 S Cr. while the
''=e d'' ruby that oscillates above 0.7 um (on the N lines
rather than the R lines) 1ies well out in the tail near
0.45. This marked reduction in susceptib1lity to damage
with increasing chromium might suggest Cr pairing as being
1nvolved. The N lines, of course, are from Cr pairs;
various authors have studied pairs, including for example
Powel1 [6) and G1l.- u

The work of Stickley I indicates certain d1fferences
in detail between discoloration produced by laser pumping
light and by ionizing radiation (i.e . x-rays). His work
indicates that the longest wavelength band in pumped laser
rods 1s near 0.l um and has a definite long wavelength tail
extending out to at least 0.7 um. He offers evidence that
'1s'' bands are in fact the same bands produced 1n ''pure''
sapphire by ionizing radiation as described by Levy [8].

We have initiated experiments to produce and study
these pumped (1.e. ultra-violet light produced) effects.
Samples included ''in house'' crystals, and crystals from
two different commerc1al sources, both being reputed to be
particularly susceptible to pump d1scoloration. These were
mounted in an uncooled ruby laser head, with no UV f1lter
provided. The ''head'' was flashed at 2 minute intervals
and samples measured for discoloration. To date, after
some 300 flashes only slight coloration has been observed,
but this is insuff1cient to be clearly outside the 11mit
of experimental detectib1lity. Future work along these
linnes should be done, perhaps w1th cooling, with a stronger
source, or perhaps with a stronng CW mercury arc.

Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements have been
made on a number of these samples. As ind1cated, special
attentionn was given to a search for trace impurities of
paramagnetic 1ons or other paramagnet1c defects in general
(1.e. color centers). Changes in the normal C+St spectra
were searched for with the intentions of correlation with
the observed optical data. A very special effort was
directed at finding the EPR band studied by Hoskins and
Sorrer [2l and by Mason and Thorp I3).

Included initially was a ''pure'' ''in house'' sapphire
that showed a clear CgSt g,PR spectra annd no change on x-ray
irradiation. A vapor phase grown sapphire, grown by another
aroup at NBS, gave no c+5t EPR signal, attesting to its
unusual purity in this respect. A number of rubies yielded
the normal Cy5t EPR spectra and no change after x-ray
coloring.

64


Subsequent to the above, the Hoskins and SSoffer line
[2,5J, which they attrribute to CHt, has been observed in
this laboratory. Two laser quality samples of 0. 05 and
0. 0l wt 5 Cr.,0- were obtained from the Naval Research ,
Labgpatory (RT). These had been colored by 10% R/ cm' sec.
oy 'co irradiation and carefully protected from all light
except dim incandescent bulbs.

The prior difficulty in observing this 1ine is not
completely understood. It is possible that it is very
easily bleached optically, and hence is not caused by the
same mechanism responslble for the optical color. They
are related of course since they have been shown to be
generated both chemically (2), and by irradiation. The
difficulty is bslieved, very definitely, to be related
to lack of propsr sample preparation in the earlier experi-
ments. It is found necessary to operate at low temperature,
4.2K.

Figure 2 is the EPR 2ine obtained,,on a 0,005 wt 3 sahg)le
grown here and irradiated by 2. 6 x 10% (R/cm' sec.) of ''ce. The
magnetic field increases to the right, the ''aero'' signal
level is indicated, and the posit1on of the zero crossing
(indicated) is chosen as the center of this unsymmetrical
line. Nearby structure as well as the asymmetry indicate
a line of some complexity. The center field of 0.176 Tesla
and the frequency of 9.4671 GHz indicate a E of 1.2,
assuming a am = 2 transition. The power leve1' 1nto the
cavity was 355 u watts.

Figure 3 is that of the 0.05 wt E NRL. sample showing
the ''line'' at two power levels. The solid curve was taken
at 355 n watts, the dashed curve at 2.51 watts. Thus the
extreme sensitivity of the sidebands of this line to power
level is well illustrated. To study completely this line
and its side bands, it is evident that the power le vels
required cover an extremely broad rannge. TThe lower end
of this range can only be observed by an excellent super-
heterodyne detector such as is available in this laboratory.

The apparent lack of the appropriate structure would
seem to rule out the existengg of the normal hyperfine
structurre anticipated for C'' , thus we currently find the
identification with CH3r to be unsatisfactory. On the
other hand the geometry of the cavity, v1z. the
P,,,,P,.- c-axis together with the rhombohedra1 rield or
tEe corundum Lattice, would make the identificationn of the
line with a am = 2 transition extremely likely . PinallY,
on cooling from 4. 2K down to 1.7K the signal strength is
reduced by a factor consistent with an activation energy
of about 7 cm-l. Thus we envision a spin 1 model in which

6s


the ground state is spin 0 lying perhaps 7 os,'' below the
2l states. The latter can be observed as a am = 2 trans-
ition under proper cond1tions. Of course, this is the
model expected for CHi+ but we currently rule this out for
other reasons.

we nave aiso given 2.6 x 1o' ;,/ag,' g ' rradiation
to several other samples of ''in house'' crystals, and as
before, protected them from strong light. A ''pure'' sapphire
crystal was found to contain CF5t, a trace of 1ron, and a
weak an. = 2 line, although the sample geometry was probably
unfavorable in this case.

Also during th1s period both optical and EPR measure-
ments were made on certain specially prepared samples of
Nd glass to test these methods as means of detecting Pt
inclusions. However, both the optical and EPR bands are
too broad to permit reasonable sensitivity, and these
methods do not seem very promising.
Puture Plans

Experiments planned for the immediate future, some in
fact under way, are outlined 1n the following 1ist:

1. Work is to commence immediately on YAG. The
obvious importance of rare earth doped YAG, together with
the report of discoloration/degradation of YAG during laser
operation, would seem to make such work significant. Damage
w1ll be produced by both optical pumping and ionizing
radiation. Optical studies and EPR measurements w1ll be
made in order to get some understanding of the nature of
this trouble. Greater emphasis wi3l be placed on the
infra-red than has been done in ruby. YAG (pure, Nd doped,
and possibly double doped with Nd and Cr) w1ll be included.
Some appropriate material is in hand and more is expected
shortly.

2. The EPR facilities to be employed are expected to
include K - band capabil1ties soon. One bridge and a Iow
temperature cavity set-up is nearly in operat1on. A
K - band optical/EPR cav1ty has been designed that, hope-
fully, will soon be constructed. TThe use of opt1cal/EPR
cavities allows optical bleaching or exc1tat1on In the
cav1ty. A true double resonance.,experiment has obvious
appl1cation in the study of thhe 'E excited state in ruby
and it may prove useful in YAG. Lastly, double resonance
of the excited state may be a means for meaningful EPR
study of laser glass. It is possible that the excited
state EPR bands may be narrow as contrasted with the broad
g;round state l2nes usually encountered. Successful work on

Since sintering in ceramics is mainly brought about by
diffusion processes, the development of successful, lonng-
range strategies needed to meet these DoD needs rests in
part on knowledge of the rates of diffusion of metal and
oxygen atoms in oxides.

Rel1able technicues for measuring oxygen d1ffusion
rates are not yet available, and therefore rel1able data for
oxygen diffusion does not ex1st for any save a few ox1des.
Thus one ob,jective of this program is to develop a reliable
technique for measuring the rate of diffusion of oxygen in
oxides.

Purther, d1ffusion rrates are notoriously sensitive to
impur1ties, and strategies for control require knowledge of
the basic rate in the pure material and of the way various
classes of imp ir1ties influence it. This in turn requires
very pure crysoals for study. To date, almost no oxide
crystals have been prepared pure enough to reveal the Intrin-
sic diffusion rates. The second ob,]ective In this area is
to prepare intrinsically pure crystals of A1-, one of the
leading ceram1c armor candidates.

The ob,jectives of this program are to develop a reliable
technique for the measurement of the rrates of diffusion of
oxygen in single crystal oxides, and to measure and interpret
data on specific oxides. Experimentally these two ob,iectives
consist of (1) extenging the sensitivty of present tech-
niques so that thhe 4%0 distribution (''concentration profile'')
in a single crystal sample can be measured, (2) comparing;
the results of these concentration prof1le measurements with
the measurements of the rate of exchange of l4( between the
gas phase and the ox1de crystal, (3) determining the depend-
ence of the diffusion rate on temperature, oxygen part1al
pressure, and 1mpurities in the solid, etc., and (l) obtain-
ing reliable ciffusion and exchange coefficients. The
experimental results will provide the basis for determIning
the mechanisms for oxide ion diffusion in the oxide studied.
Currently, rutile (T10.,) is the oxide of interest. A mass
spectrrometer is being; fsed to determine isotope ratios.

Almost all work on the pro,ject during the past months
has been focused on the construction of the inlet system for
the isotope ratio mass spectrometer - consisting of roughing
and high vacuum manifolds, sample and reference transfer
lines, sample and reference storage, manometers and mole cular
leak inlet. The system has the capacity for three oxygen
references and four carbon dioxide references of different
isotopic composition. Oxygen samples on the order of 0.3
standard cc can be transferred from the diffusion furnace,
stored and analyzed. It w1ll be possible to convert the
oxygen to C9 using a graphite filament before analysis with
the mass spectrometer or to analyze it directly.

The ob,jectives of this program are, first, the growth
of aluminum oxide mono- and bicrystals of sufficient physi-
cal perfection and chemical purity for use as research
materials; second, the reduction of both cation and anion
impurities in vapor grown aluminum oxide crystals to
sufficiently low levels to permit meaningful property
measurements at the intrinsic level; and third, the exten-
sion of the technique to other materials of interest.

During this reporting period, work has continued on the
g;rowth of b1crystals containing symmetrical tilt boundaries,
primarily devoted to ani investigation of possible variations
in the growth technique designed to reduce or ellminate the
occasional veils which form in the crystal when the growth
cycle 1s interrupted. The use of a brief etching period of
30 to 45 minutes duration at the beginning of each growth
cycle, during which only hydrogen and chlorine are passed
over the crystal, appears to be sufficient. However,
attempts to utilize this etching on the original seed
crystals have shown that chemical polishing in phosphoric
acid is still required to completely remove mechan1cal
damage resulting from sawing and grinding the seed plates.

Additional bicrystal specimens have been suppled to
Dr. Heuer at Case Western Reserve Un1versity for use in the
ARPA program on Mass Transport in Oxides.

Much of the effort has been devoted to the problem of
improving the chemical purity of the crystals by changes in
the technique and apparatus. Neutron activation analysis of
representat1ve samples has been completed and are compared


with the previously reported spectrochemical analysis in
Table 1. Only four impurity elements were actually detected

In Table , analyses of the aluminum metal used as a
source material are given, both before and after use in the
chlorinator. Comparison of these analyses with those of the
crystals in Table l shows that considerable improvement in
purity is inherent in the growth process. The comparison
also suggests that, at the purity level under considerationn,
the aluminum may well be the chief source of contamination
in the crystals. The marked reduction of silicon in the
aluminum after use and its subsequent detection in the
crystals indi2ates that this may be the most troublesome
impurity. Reaction between the chlorine and metallic parts
of the system is also evident from the new impurities found
in the aluminm after use. Thhe disappearance of gallium
from the aluminum after use indicates that it also is being
transported. A particular search was made in the cry stals
for gallium but 1f present, 1t is there at less than the
0. 003 ppm levsl, the detection limit for activation analy sis.

A new furnace and chlorinator have been designed and
are currently under construction. In this apparatus, con-
tact between chlorine g,as, aluminum chloride and metal
parts will be minimized in order to reduce exposure to this
source of contamination.

Single crystals of high purity AJV have been provided
in a cooperative effort to the ARPA Laser Materials Program
at NBS for use in spin resonnance studies where a chromium-
free specimen was essential.

Plans for the next reporting period include completion
of the new growth apparatus and continued emphasis on
improvement in purity levels. The use of 6N aluminum as
the source material will be tried. The possibility of
utilizing sparrk source mass spectrometry to determine the
silicon and magnnesium levels will be investigated, as well
as the use of NMR to determine, at least qualitatively, the
hydrogen ion content of the crystals.
